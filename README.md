# Arkku's Visual Studio Code Theme

A simple theme for VS Code created by [Kimmo Kulovesi](https://arkku.dev/).

Some colors have been copied from other themes, such as
[Night Owl](https://github.com/sdras/night-owl-vscode-theme),
[One Dark Pro](https://github.com/Binaryify/OneDark-Pro), and
GitHub's syntax highlighting. Most are based on
[my ancient xterm and vim color schemes](https://github.com/arkku/dotfiles),
however, and future versions will probably be increasingly original.

The theme is relatively minimalistic, i.e., most colors are fairly similar
in contrast and not every possible type of entity has a distinct
color. **Keywords** are **bold** in most programming languages.

Both light and dark variants are included, but light background is the
"classic" version that I mainly use.
