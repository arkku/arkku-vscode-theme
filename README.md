# Arkku's Visual Studio Code Theme

A simple theme for VS Code created by [Kimmo Kulovesi](https://arkku.dev/).

Some colors have been copied from other themes, such as [Night Owl](https://github.com/sdras/night-owl-vscode-theme)
as well as from GitHub's syntax highlighting. Most are based on my ancient
xterm and vim color schemes, however, and future versions will probably
be increasingly original.

The theme is relatively minimalistic, i.e., most colors are fairly similar
in contrast and not every possible type of entity has a distinct color.
